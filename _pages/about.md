I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/),[Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My major is Data Science and Big Data Technology. I'm a former Biology Olympiad contestant.

My research interest includes [automated mechanism design](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/amd_overview.cp03.pdf) (a subfield of computational economics), [data-driven decision making](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5481) in operations research, and the utilization of deep models in biology & other natural science disciplines. I have done thorough surveys and worked on papers about these topics.

I'm fortunately to be advised by [Prof. Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm) in my undergraduate research at the [Center on Frontiers of Computational Science](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/index.htm). I'm also grateful for the guidance of [Prof. Pengyi Shi](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~shi178/) during my summer intern research. I'm thrilled to join [Prof. Han Liu](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/liu-han.html)'s studies on AI for science topics in the forthcoming autumn.


I'm an active amateur badminton player and fan of <a href="https://www.manutd.com/" style="color: red;">Manchester United</a>.
